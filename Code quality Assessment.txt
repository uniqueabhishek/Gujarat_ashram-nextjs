Code Quality Assessment Complete ✅
I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of your ashram NextJS codebase. Here's what I found:
📊 Overall Score: 5.3/10 - Good foundation but needs significant improvements
Your Project Strengths:
✅ Modern tech stack (Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Prisma)
✅ Feature-rich CMS with image management, drag-and-drop, animations
✅ Beautiful UI with custom branding and responsive design
✅ Well-organized component structure and API client pattern
🔴 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (Must fix before production)
1. Hardcoded Admin Credentials
Your login page literally displays admin/admin123 on screen and checks them client-side. Anyone can log in.
2. Zero API Authentication
ALL 15+ API endpoints have no authentication checks. Any visitor can:
Delete all menu items, images, and content
Upload malicious files
Modify contact information
3. localStorage Authentication
Authentication stored client-side only - easily bypassed via browser console. These three issues mean your site can be completely compromised by anyone.
📉 Code Quality Issues:
Category	Score	Main Issue
TypeScript	5/10	Excessive any types (50+ instances)
Components	6/10	Monolithic files (841 & 1,677 lines)
Code Duplication	5/10	Menu rendering repeated 3x, URL validation 4x
State Management	6/10	Prop drilling, 10+ useState in admin
API Routes	7/10	No input validation (should use Zod)
Error Handling	4/10	Generic try-catch, no user feedback
Testing	0/10	No tests whatsoever
⚡ Performance Issues:
Images 300-500KB each - Not using Next.js <Image> component
5MB+ hero section - No lazy loading or WebP conversion
Large JS bundle - No code splitting
10+ API calls on every page load - No caching
📋 My Recommendations:
Immediate Priority (Security)
Implement proper JWT authentication server-side
Add auth middleware to all API routes
Use HTTP-only secure cookies
Remove hardcoded credentials
High Priority (Code Quality)
Replace all any with proper TypeScript interfaces
Break down 841 & 1,677 line components into smaller modules
Extract duplicate code (URL validation, menu rendering)
Add Zod validation to API routes
High Priority (Performance)
Use Next.js <Image> component for all images
Compress/optimize images
Implement lazy loading
Add bundle analysis
I've written a detailed 300+ line assessment report with specific file references, code examples, and fix recommendations. The report covers security, TypeScript usage, component structure, performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. Would you like me to:
Start fixing the critical security issues first?
Focus on a specific area (TypeScript, components, performance)?
Prioritize differently based on your timeline?
